# Artale Database 

A project, that is unaffiliated with the developers of Artale on Maplestory Worlds, to compile the details about various aspects of the game <br />
instead of having to refer to a google document or spreadsheet. 


# Technology Used 
. MySQL <br />
. Spring <br />
. REST <br />

# Sheet currently being worked on:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ndLiWvfTMYpI4vnQwAka_TaziJPYQYj4JgvU9dE-eYU/edit?usp=sharing <br />
This sheet is being used to compile what each mobs can drop before creating new sheets to separate the equips by what they are, hat, top, gloves etc, and then creating the drop table. Edited: 5:15am Eastern 1/20/2025<br />
